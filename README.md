My name is **Ionescu Liviu Grigore** (_ilegeul_ for my colleagues) and I'm a real programmer (for those old enough to know the [joke](http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/real.programmers.html)).

## Interrests

I'm currently interrested in solutions for improving the quality of embedded software, mainly by using reproducible builds and extensive multi-plaform testing, with an emphasise on C++ projects.

## Projects

The main open source projects that I am involved with are:

### The xPack Reproducible Build Framework

The **xPack** project aims to provide a set of cross-platform tools to manage, configure and build complex, modular, multi-target (multi-architecture, multi-board, multi-toolchain) projects, with an emphasis on C/C++ and bare-metal embedded projects.

- [xPack Development Tools](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/)

### µOS++ IIIe

The **µOS++** project is a POSIX-like, portable, open source, royalty-free, multi-tasking real-time framework intended for 32/64-bits embedded applications, written in C++.

- [3rd party libraries](https://github.com/xpack-3rd-party/)

### Eclipse Embedded CDT

**Eclipse Embedded CDT** is an open source project that includes a family of Eclipse plug-ins and tools for multi-platform embedded cross (Arm and RISC-V) development, based on GNU toolchains.
