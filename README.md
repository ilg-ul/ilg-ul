My name is **Ionescu Liviu Grigore** (_ilg_, _ilegeul_ or _eunete_ for colleagues and friends) and I'm a senior IT engineer. Or should I say a _real programmer_? (for those old enough to know the [joke](http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/real.programmers.html))

## Interrests

I'm currently interrested in solutions for improving the quality of embedded software, mainly by using reproducible builds and extensive multi-plaform testing, with an emphasise on C++ projects.

## Projects

The main open source projects that I am involved with are:

### The xPack Reproducible Build Framework

The **xPack** project aims to provide a set of cross-platform tools to manage, configure and build complex, modular, multi-target (multi-architecture, multi-board, multi-toolchain) projects, with an emphasis on C/C++ and bare-metal embedded projects.

- [xpack-dev-tools](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/) - multi-platform binary xPack development tools
- [ilg-vscode.xpack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ilg-vscode.xpack) - VS Code xPack extension

### ÂµOS++

The **ÂµOS++** project is a POSIX-like, portable, open source, royalty-free, multi-tasking real-time framework intended for 32/64-bits embedded applications, written in C++.

- [xpack-3rd-party](https://github.com/xpack-3rd-party/) - 3rd party libraries

### Eclipse Embedded CDT

**Eclipse Embedded CDT** is an open source project that includes a family of Eclipse plug-ins and tools for multi-platform embedded cross (Arm and RISC-V) development, based on GNU toolchains.
