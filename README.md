My name is **Ionescu Liviu Grigore** (_ilg_, _ilegeul_ or _eunete_ for colleagues and friends) and I'm a senior software engineer. Or should I say a _real programmer_? (for those old enough to remember the [joke](http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/real.programmers.html))

## Interrests

I'm currently interrested in solutions for improving the quality of **embedded software**, mainly by using **reproducible builds frameworks** and extensive **multi-plaform testing** (Arm & RISC-V), with an emphasise on **C++ and bare-metal embedded** projects.

## Projects

The main open source projects that I have fun with are:

### The xPack Reproducible Build Framework

The **xPack** project aims to provide a set of cross-platform tools to manage, configure and build complex, modular, multi-target (multi-architecture, multi-board, multi-toolchain) projects, with an emphasis on C/C++ and bare-metal embedded projects.

### The ÂµOS++ Framework

The **ÂµOS++** project (_micro oh É›s plus plus_) is a POSIX-like, portable, open source, royalty-free, multi-tasking real-time framework intended for 32/64-bits embedded applications, written in C++.

### Eclipse Embedded CDT

**Eclipse Embedded CDT** is an open source project that includes a family of Eclipse plug-ins and tools for multi-platform embedded cross (Arm and RISC-V) development, based on GNU toolchains.
